DATA SET INFORMATIO 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Check the README.txt file for further details about this dataset.

Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. 


STUDY DESIGN
The study will take the raw data described above and produce averages of the different measurements for each subject during each activity.

CODE BOOK
Raw data are formatted as describer in features.txt file provided with the data.

The tidy data have units as follows:

Acc: m/s^2
Acc Jerk: m/s^3
Freq : Hz

The data are given in *tidyMeanData.txt* arranged as follows 

The data in *tidyMeanData.txt* are organized as follows:
###Columns

1. Subject ID
2. Average when LAYING
3. Average when SITTING
4. Average when STANDING
5. Average when WALKING
6. Average when WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
7. Average when WALKING_UPSTAIRS
